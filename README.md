### index.html

The `index.html` file defines the structure of the calculator.  
It includes:
- Two input fields for numbers
- Four buttons for arithmetic operations

- A title named **Aryan Calculator**

Each button triggers the same JavaScript function with a different operator.

Example:
```html
<button onclick="calculate('+')">+</button>
